# PokerAI
Deep learning project to improve PokerBots against human players.

## Vision
Facebook prove with Pluribus that theoretically it is posibile to beat human players with classical tree-algorithmic-structures in a poker game.
Now we want to develop a deep neural network bot witch can at least beat moderate to good players in poker.

## Steps
+ create a parser for pokergame logs (e.g. Pluribus, Pokerstars..)
+ draw up a theoretically concept for a artificial intelligence in poker
+ create a lerning concept
+ test the results
+ improve concepts
+ release a automated bot with a corresponding API
